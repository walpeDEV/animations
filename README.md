This repository contains all my projects featuring animations or creative elements that I have personally implemented primarily using Vanilla JS or WebGL.
Also in case you identify any areas for improvement - such as coding standards, readability, or performance optimizations - I would appreciate your constructive feedback.

Enjoy my shitty animations :)
